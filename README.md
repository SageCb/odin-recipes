# odin-recipes
Well i'm starting the recipes project now. In this project i'm going to create
 a webpage which will have different recipes as well as their seperate webpages
 in themselves and also picutres(if possible).

In this project i will show you my skills of basic html which is to create a 
webpage do all the heading stuffs and add pictures and also to have links to
the recipes. I will use visualcode as my text editor and also linux as the
overall os.
