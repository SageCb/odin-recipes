    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have loads of strawberry-based desserts on this site and certainly no shortage of variations of strawberry cake and cupcakes.</p>
    <p>What I love about these though is that they are pretty straight forward with a one-bowl vanilla cupcake base and chunks of strawberries 
    in the batter.</p><p> There's plenty of strawberry flavor from the chunks of berries and then they are topped with a delicious strawberry buttercream. 
    These cupcakes are light, moist and full of flavor. I'm so in love!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon strawberry extract</li>
        <li>1¾ cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh strawberries, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 12 cupcake pan cups or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time,
            then stir in the strawberry extract. Combine the self-rising flour and salt; stir into the batter just until blended. 
            Fold in strawberries last. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. When cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter. Frost with desired frosting.</li>
    </ol>
