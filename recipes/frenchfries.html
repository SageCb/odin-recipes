    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Now here is one of my favourite junk food. Yeah it sounds bad but French Fries are the best. They are available everywhere in the world afaik.They 
    are very popular here in South East Asia.</p><p> Many people almost always eat it once everyday usually in the afternoon. They pour <em>ketchup, chatni,
    chicken masala and mayoniesse</em> to bring out that extra flavour<em>(yum)</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li> 1 medium russet potato</li>
        <li>  1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>  Â½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>  freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the basket with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Cut potato in half lengthwise, and then into 1/4-inch slices. Cut slices into 1/4-inch sticks.
            Put fries in a bowl and rinse well under cold running water. Drain potatoes and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Combine fries and oil in a bowl and toss until well combined. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and season 
            with pepper; toss to combine. Working in batches if necessary, lay fries in an even layer in the prepared basket; don't overlap.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 7 minutes. Turn fries and cook until golden brown and crisp, 7 to 9 more minutes.
             Remove from air fryer and sprinkle with more salt.</li>
    </ol>
